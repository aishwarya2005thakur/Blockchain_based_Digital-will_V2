# Blockchain Smart Contract Project

## 📌 Overview

This project is a blockchain-based **smart contract** that enables secure, transparent, and tamper-proof execution of digital agreements. By leveraging blockchain technology, the contract eliminates the need for intermediaries and ensures that rules are automatically enforced once predefined conditions are met.

Key features include:

* ✅ Decentralized execution
* 🔒 Trustless & secure transactions
* ⚡ Fast and transparent settlement
* 📜 Verifiable and immutable records

* **Smart Contract Language**: \[ Move / Rust ]
* **Frameworks/Tools**: \[ Move CLI ]
* **Frontend (optional)**: React + Web3.js / Aptos Wallet Adapter
* **Backend (optional)**: Node.js + supabase

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aishwarya2005thakur/Blockchain_based_Digital-will_V2.git
cd Blockchain_based_Digital-will_V2
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Compile Smart Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
# or for Aptos
aptos move compile
```

### 4. Deploy Contracts

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
# or Aptos
aptos move publish --profile default
```

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## 🖥️ Usage

* Connect wallet (MetaMask / Aptos Wallet / Phantom).
* Interact with the contract via UI or CLI.
* Example functions:

  * `createAgreement()` → Initialize a smart contract instance.
  * `executeAgreement()` → Trigger execution when conditions are met.
  * `withdrawFunds()` → Secure fund release.

---

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests ensure contract correctness, covering:

* Deployment
* Function execution
* Edge cases & failure handling
* Security checks (reentrancy, overflows, etc.)

Run tests:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
